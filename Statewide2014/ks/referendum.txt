"Constitutional Amendment","","Explanatory statement.  The constitution currently prohibits the operation of lotteries except for specifically authorized lotteries.  A raffle is a lottery and is illegal under current law. A vote for this proposition would permit the legislature to authorize charitable raffles operated or conducted by religious, charitable, fraternal, educational and veterans nonprofit organizations subject to the limitations listed.  Nonprofit organizations would be prohibited from contracting with a professional lottery vendor to manage, operate or conduct a charitable raffle. A vote against this proposition would continue the current prohibition against all raffles.","Shall the following be adopted? ?3d.  Regulation of `raffles` authorized.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3 of article 15 of the constitution of the state of Kansas, the legislature may authorize the licensing, conduct and regulation of charitable raffles by nonprofit religious, charitable, fraternal, educational and veterans organizations.  A raffle means a game of chance in which each participant buys a ticket or tickets from a nonprofit organization with each ticket providing an equal chance to win a prize and the winner being determined by a random drawing.  Such organizations shall not use an electronic gaming machine or vending machine to sell tickets or conduct raffles.  No such nonprofit organization shall contract with a professional raffle or other lottery vendor to manage, operate or conduct any raffle.  Raffles shall be licensed and regulated by the Kansas department of revenue, office of charitable gaming or successor agency.","","","","","205000"
